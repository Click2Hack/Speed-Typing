2. Making the Game More Interesting:
Here are some ideas to make the game more engaging and challenging:

a. Add Levels or Difficulty:
You can introduce multiple difficulty levels, where at higher levels, the time limit is reduced or the sentences are more complex.

c
Copy code
#define EASY_TIME_LIMIT 20
#define MEDIUM_TIME_LIMIT 15
#define HARD_TIME_LIMIT 10
Then, ask the player to choose their difficulty at the start.

b. Typing Speed and Accuracy:
Introduce additional scoring based on typing speed (faster completion) and accuracy (correct characters typed in the right order). You could give bonus points for typing the sentence under the time limit or penalize them for errors.

c. Add a Countdown Timer:
Show a countdown timer (e.g., 3, 2, 1, GO!) before each round to make it more intense.

d. Add Multiplayer:
Allow two or more players to compete against each other. The first player to type the sentence correctly wins the round, and the game continues with the next sentence.

e. Add a "Leaderboard":
Track high scores over multiple rounds, and store the leaderboard on the local machine.
